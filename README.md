# ORCA
ORCA is a tool for injecting mods into Kirby Air Ride netplay

## How To Use

- Run `ORCA.exe`

- Under the Mod Injector window, click `Set Dolphin Dir` to set the directory containing the Dolphin.exe. ORCA assumes the User settings are local. If a User folder or a `portable.txt` is next to the Dolphin exe, your build is set to local.
